This includes ALL POTION EFFECTS, including glowing, levitation, haste, mining fatigue, etc.

Features:

craft splash by just combining the potion with gunpowder
Disable in config.yml

Allow higher level potions, change 'overpowered-potions' to true and then change 'maxlevel' to whatever level, under 256

Change of duration, change 'duration' in config.yml to whatever (seconds). This is added to ensure semi-balanced gameplay based on your own use
